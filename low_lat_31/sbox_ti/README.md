# Low Latency and Low Randomness First Order Threshold Implementation of AES S-Box
This repository contains the source code of S-Boxes in our paper **First-Order Hardware Masking of AES with Low Randomness and Low Latency**.

Part of the code are taken from [Masked_AES_hardware](https://github.com/ECSIS-lab/curse_of_re-encryption/tree/main/Masked_AES_hardware).

The correction terms are extracted from [AESTIScheme](https://github.com/GitHub-lancel/AESTIScheme).
